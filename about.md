Having studied quantitative economics and worked on the trading floor of one of the bulge brakets, I enjoy thinking about questions related to investment and the financial market. 

While I am trying my best to have educated and informed views on those big questions (keywords: the Fed, inflation, emerging market, etc), I am most interested in personal and practical questions closely related to individuals' financial experiences.   

I would be thrilled if you, my audience, find anything helpful on this site.

## Design of My Logo 
##### (Yes, it's a Bok Choy)
<br>
Chinese retail investors call themselves "chives" because their investing experiences remind them of this particular veggie's expendability and regular harvesting. Thus, the term "chives" can be seen as regular investors' acknolwedgement of the challenges and risks they face in financial markets, which are often characterized by a lack transparency and by volatile and speculative practices.  

With this slang in mind, I chose "Bok Choy" to be my site logo as I reject the notion of being an expendable entity continually harvested without gain. Bok Choy is a strong veggie that thrives in various conditions (and is nutritious!). These qualities make this veggie a perfect candidate to represent my goal of bringing forth a narrative of empowerment and informed investing, thereby paving the way for a more equitable market environment.
